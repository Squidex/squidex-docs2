The subscription is used in the Squidex Cloud to manage the payment. The customer is created for the team, and every team admin can manage the subscription.

If you loose access to all user accounts, for example because the admins have left the company, you can create a support ticket. We can then remvoe the app from the current team and you can create a new team. The API calls are shared between all apps, but you can restrict the number of API calls for each client.

To simplify this process you can also assign an app to a team. Each team admin can then manage the subscriptions.

Go the billing portal to change your payment details and to download invoices.
