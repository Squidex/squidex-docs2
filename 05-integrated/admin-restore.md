Restores an app from a backup. You can directly use the URL from your Squidex instance where the backup has been created.

Furthermore you can use file URLs if the backup is located on the machine where Squidex is running, e.g.

```
// Windows
file://c:/backups/backup.zip

// Unix
file://home/backups/backup.zip
```
