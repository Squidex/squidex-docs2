A contributor is a user who has access to your app.

You can use the the following roles:

* **Reader**: can view contents and assets.
* **Editor**: Can also create, update and delete contents and assets.
* **Developer**: Can also create, modify and delete schemas and rules.
* **Owner**: Can also manage settings and manage contributors and subscriptions.

A user does not need an account before you add him or her to your app. If a user with the entered email-address does not exist, an invitation e-mail will be send out.
