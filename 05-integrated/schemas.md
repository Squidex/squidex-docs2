A schema defines the structure of the content and is defined by the fields and their settings.

### Fields

Each field can have the following states:

 * **Locked**: The field cannot be updated, unlocked or deleted anymore.
 * **Hidden**: The field will not be returned by the api and only visible in the Management UI.
 * **Disabled**: The field content cannot be edited in the Management UI. Do not use it for required fields.

You have to publish your schema before you can create content.

### Scripts

Scripts can be used to implement custom workflows. In scripts all available information are available from the `ctx` (Context) variable.

For example:

 * `ctx.user` will provide user information, for example `ctx.user.id` or `ctx.user.email`.
 * `ctx.data` will provide the new data value of the content item.
 * `ctx.oldData` will provide the current data value of the content item.
 * `ctx.status`: The new status when a content is changed or the current status otherwise.
 * `ctx.statusOld`: The current status of a content item. Undefined for new items.
 * `ctx.contentId`: The IF of the content item as a string.

Possible operations are:

 * `replace()`: Replaces the content with the modified version.
 * `reject()`: Reject the operation and return a HTTP 400 (Bad request) instead.
 * `disallow()`: Reject the operation because of security reasons and return a HTTP 403 (Forbidden) instead.
