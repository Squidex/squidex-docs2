The subscription is used in the Squidex Cloud to manage the payment. The customer is created for the user, who creates the subscription. Therefore a subscription is locked to a user (called the **Plan Owner**) and no other user can change the subscription for an app. Once the subscription has been created you can remove the user from the list of contributors and add him back when the subscription needs to change.

If you loose access to the user account, for example because the plan owner has left the company, you can create a support ticket to cancel the subscription. No data will be lost, but you can then resubscribe from another user account.

To simplify this process you can also assign an app to a team. Each team admin can then manage the subscriptions.

Go the billing portal to change your payment details and to download invoices.
