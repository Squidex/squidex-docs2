# Welcome to Squidex

## What is Squidex?

Squidex is a content management hub or content management system (CMS). A central place to manage all your content.

For example:

* Dynamic elements for your mobile Apps.
* Blog posts and articles for your website.
* Configuration data for your backend.
* Rich and structured data for your applications.

In contrast to a traditional CMS, Squidex is headless and does not provide the front end. This frees you up to choose a technology of your choice to create a thoroughly awesome user experience!
