# Scripting

## Introduction

This documentation is based on the _FoodCrunch_ use case. Please open the link below alongside this page to understand the examples.

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Why Scripting?

Some business rules around security and validation are hard to solve with a generic feature that works for everybody and is easy to use. The workflow system has limitations as well and you cannot write permissions that depend on the data of the content.

In general, scripting can be used to handle gaps in the Squidex feature set.&#x20;

### Scripting for Content

You can create scripts that run whenever a content item is created, updated, deleted, queried or when the status changes (e.g. from Draft to Published).

Scripts can be defined in the schema editor:

1. Go to your **App** (1).
2. Go to the **Schema** (2) settings.
3. Select the schema (3) you want to write a script for, i.e `startups` in this example.
4. Select the **Scripts** (4) tab
5. Select the tab (5), depending on when you want the script to run, to work with the editor.

In the editor, you can define scripts for the following actions:

* **Query** script is executed whenever a content item is queried with the API, but not when queried by the Management UI.
* **Prepare Query** is called once for all content items of the current query. It can be used to precompute or prefetch data.
* **Create** script is executed before a content item is created.
* **Change** script is executed before the status of a content item is changed. When you use scheduling to change the status of a content item in the future, the script is called just before the status is changed and not when you schedule it. This can also stop your scheduling, when the script fails or it rejects the change.
* **Delete** script is executed before a content item is deleted.
* **Update** script is executed before a content item is updated.

Content creation and updates happen in the following order:

1. The content item is loaded. If it does not exist, the API responds with 404 (NotFound).
2. The data from the request is validated. The API responds with 400 (BadRequest) for invalid data.
3. **The script is executed.**
4. The data from the request is enriched with configured default values.
5. The constraints, such as unique fields are checked.

This means that you have the guarantee in your scripts, that the data is always valid and that you cannot violate constraints such as unique fields when you auto-generate or change content data.

### Scripting for Assets

Asset scripts can be defined in the settings:

1. Go to your App (1).
2. Go to the **Settings** (2).
3. Select the **Asset Scripts** (3) menu item.
4. Select the script type (4) you want to edit.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the editor you can define scripts for the following actions:

* **Annotate** script is executed before the metadata of an asset is changed.
* **Create** script is executed before an asset is created.
* **Moved** script is executed before an asset is moved to another folder.
* **Delete** script is executed before an asset is deleted.
* **Update** script is executed before an asset is replaced with a new file.

## Execution and Variables

The scripts are executed in a Sandbox. You do not have access to the file system and only to allowed functions. Only the ES5 JavaScript syntax is implemented so far, which means you cannot use Lambda expressions, Promises or classes.

### Variables

All variables are accessible over the `ctx` (Context) variable. The following fields can be used for all scripts:

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In addition to that for content "Published" is used when the status is changed to "Published" and "Unpublished" is used when the previous status is "Published". |
| `ctx.user`      | Object | Information about the current user. See next table.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Methods

#### Control Methods

These methods are used to make changes to the content item or to reject changes.

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replace()`      | Content scripts only. Tells Squidex that you have made modifications to the `ctx.data` object and that this change should be applied to the content.                                  |
| `disallow()`     | Tells Squidex that this operation is not allowed and that a `403 (Forbidden)` status code should be returned. The user will see an alert in the Management UI. |
| `reject(reason)` | Tells Squidex that this operation is not valid and that a `400 (BadRequest)`status code should be returned. The user will see an alert in the Management UI.   |
| `complete()` | Tells Squidex that the script should complete successfully.   |

#### Helper Methods

Squidex provides a set of general helper functions for scripting and rule formatting.

## Use Cases

### Debugging: Write the Context to a Field

If you want to understand your data structure and the context object, you can just write it to a string field.

```javascript
ctx.data.debug.iv = JSON.stringify(ctx, null, 2);
// Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
replace(); 
```

### Do Not Return Sensitive Information When Queried by a Client

```javascript
if (ctx.isClient) { // ctx Variable contains all Context information
    ctx.data.password.iv = '********';
    // Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
    replace(); 
}
```

### Do Not Allow the Client to Set Fields

```javascript
if (ctx.isClient && ctx.data.password.iv) {
    // Tell Squidex to return a 403 (Forbidden)
    disallow();
}
```

### Ensure that Two Fields Have the Same Value

```javascript
if (data.password.iv !== data.passwordConfirm.iv) {
    // Tell Squidex to return a 400 (Bad Request)
    reject('Passwords must be the same');
}
```

### Ensure that Only a Specific User can Publish Content

```javascript
if (ctx.operation === 'Published' && ctx.user.email !== 'content@master.com') {
    // Reject the call if the publisher has another email address.
    reject('You are not allowed to publish the content');
}
```

### Compute Field From Other Values

Store in a separate field if another field has a valid value:

```javascript
ctx.data.hasPassword = { iv: !!ctx.data.password.iv };
// Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
replace();
```

Calculate the slug for a content title automatically:

```javascript
ctx.data.slug.iv = slugify(ctx.data.title.iv);
// Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
replace();
```

Calculate the number of words in a Markdown field:

```javascript
ctx.data.wordCount.iv = wordCount(markdown2Text(ctx.data.html.iv)));
// Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
replace();
```

Calculate the number of characters in a HTML field:

```javascript
ctx.data.characterCount.iv = characterCount(html2Text(ctx.data.html.iv)));
// Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
replace();
```

### Enrich Your Content with Data from External Services

You can use the `getJSON` function to enrich the content with data from external services. This example is a little bit more complicated that the other examples above, but let's jump into the code first:

```javascript
var url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1';

var headers = {
    ApiKey: 'secret'
};

getJSON(url, function(result) {
    data.title.iv = result.title;
    // Tell Squidex that the content should be replaced.
    replace();
}, headers);

// I am done
```

When you make an asynchronous call to another service or content, the script engine cannot stop the script automatically. Therefore, it is very important to finish the script with a call to `replace()`, even if you do not make a change to the content data.

## Restrictions

There are some existing restrictions:

1. You cannot include external libraries.
2. You cannot make calls to external services, except `getJSON`.
3. Scripts will timeout after 200ms of CPU execution.
4. Scripts will timeout after 5 seconds of total execution, e.g. waiting for external services with `getJSON`.
