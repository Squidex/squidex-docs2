# Assets

This documentation is based on the _FoodCrunch_ use case. Please open the link below alongside this page to understand the examples.

{% endcontent-ref %}

An asset in Squidex is a static content such as a file, a document, an image, a video or any other media file. These assets may be used along with the data in the Content area.

An example for our _FoodCrunch_ user case could be the **Logo** for the startups.

Assets can be uploaded to the root or in folders. For example, assets of type images could be uploaded to a folder called _images_.

To create a folder click![](../../../.gitbook/assets/2022-11-06\_01-05.png)icon (2), enter a **Folder Name** (3) e.g. _images_ and click **Create** (4).&#x20;

## Asset Properties

An asset has properties and some of these properties can be modified once you've uploaded the asset.&#x20;

Properties such as **Name**, **Slug**, **Tags** and **Metadata** can be added and/or modified. Assets can also be protected from anonymous download by checking the **Protected** box. This makes the asset private, a token must be used to download it directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
All assets uploaded are public by default.&#x20;
