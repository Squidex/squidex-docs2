Squidex provides the capability of querying your uploaded assets. You can query (search) by **tags**, or **name**, or use a combination of both.

The following tag types are supported as of this writing:

* `image`
* `image/small`
* `image/large`
* `type/png`
* `type/jpg`

The following example shows how to search based on a tag `type/png`.

Additionally, you can also save the query and decide whether or not to share it with others. To save the query, simply click on the star button next to the search fields.

On the pop-up window, enter a name under **Name your query** (1) and click **Create** (2).
