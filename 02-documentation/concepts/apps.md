# Apps

## What is an App?

An app is the highest level or organization in the Squidex hierarchy. Your content lives within a project. Furthermore a project has:

* An optional display name, description and logo to make your app discoverable in the overview.
* **Schemas** to define the structure of your content.
* **Content** itself.
* **Assets** that belong to your app and are linked to your content.
* **Rules** to model business workflows.
* **Custom workflow** definitions.
* **Collaborators** who can work on your content with roles and permissions.
* A subscription and an associated plan in the Squidex Cloud.
