### Can every contributor subscribe to a paid plan

Yes, every contributor can do that. When you subscribe to a plan a new customer is created in the billing system under your name and only the user who subscribed to the plan can cancel it or move to another plan. If this person leaves the company and you do not have access to his account anymore you can open a support ticket and we can handle this case for you.
