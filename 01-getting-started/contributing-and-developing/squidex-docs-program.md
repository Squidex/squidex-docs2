# Squidex Docs Program

### Program Overview <a href="program_overview" id="program_overview"></a>

Squidex Docs is our knowledge base for the community. If you are a technical writer looking for assignments, you've come to the right place. We pay rates for your articles.

Thank you for contributing to Squidex. We look forward to reading your articles!

### Program Rules <a href="program_rules" id="program_rules"></a>

* Articles must be in English, with proper spelling and grammar.
* You must submit original content. Do not plagiarize from other Squidex Docs or other sites.
* Articles that need extensive editing or have technical errors are not accepted.
* Articles submitted to Squidex are not exclusive to Squidex Docs. You can republish the article elsewhere after submission.
* After payment, the content becomes the property of Squidex. We may reuse the content as needed or rewrite it to improve readability.
* Do not mention other providers that offer similar services to Squidex, except for feature comparisons.

### Payments and Rates <a href="payments_and_rates" id="payments_and_rates"></a>

* We base payments on the amount of original writing, **excluding code blocks**.
* We may edit articles for clarity, and the length may change significantly during the editing process.
* We review your account for payment eligibility.
* We pay using bank transfer.
* These payment rates are guidelines; we evaluate each article individually.
* If you desire the highest payment for your article, we recommend these resources:

### New Articles <a href="new_articles" id="new_articles"></a>

New articles that are ready to publish **without editing by Squidex **are eligible for the highest payments.

* New articles greater than 1500 words are eligible for up to **$400**.
* New articles between 750 and 1500 words are eligible for up to **$200**.
* New articles less than 750 words are eligible for up to **$100**.

### Article Updates <a href="article_updates" id="article_updates"></a>

With pre-approval, we pay 50% of the new article rate for updates to existing articles. Updates should contain significant new information, and should not plagiarize the original article.

### Technical Summaries <a href="technical_summaries" id="technical_summaries"></a>

We may choose to accept technical summaries at 50% of the new article rate on a case-by-case basis. Technical summaries are incomplete articles that summarize a technical solution but do not comply with our style guide. Technical summaries require editing by our team before publishing. If you are an subject-matter expert on a particular topic, consider submitting a technical summary for us to review.

### Permitted Topics <a href="permitted_topics" id="permitted_topics"></a>

Users reading your articles are primarily interested in server administration and applications. Therefore, our documentation library consists of these major categories:

* **Installation Guides** are step-by-step installation and configuration instructions.
* **Quickstart Guides** are useful for users who want to have tutorial how to build a blog or similar application using Squidex.
* **Best Practices** are short documents that explain the best way to do a particular task, especially how to gain the best performance with Squidex.
* **Troubleshooting Guides** are step-by-step instructions to resolve common problems.
* **Content Modelling Guides** are instructions how to model a use case, e.g. a Hotel information portal or ticketing system with Squidex.
* **Frequently Asked Questions** are common questions with short answers, rarely more than one paragraph, and link to other documents as much as possible.

### Submission Process <a href="submission_process" id="submission_process"></a>

There are five steps to the article submission process. Please save a local copy of your article before submitting it for review.

1. Please write your article in Markdown.&#x20;
2. After you have edited and tested your article, send the article to [sebastian@squidex.io](mailto:sebastian@squidex.io) to prove that you have written the article.
3. Create a pull request to the [Squidex Docs repository](https://github.com/squidex/squidex-docs2) at Github.
4. We perform an initial screening for spelling, formatting, grammar, plagiarism, and topic suitability. This review may take several days. We will contact you over Github and ask for changes.
5. We perform a full technical review of articles that pass the initial screening. We test all the steps exactly as written. The article must pass this test without errors to be accepted. Depending on the number of pending submissions, the process may take a few weeks.
6. If we approve the article, we will send you a payment proposal.
