## Using Squidex Cloud

You can now start with an empty App (click [here](../02-documentation/concepts/apps.md) to read what an App in Squidex is) or select one of the starter Apps that we provide. Starter Apps come with sample schema(s) and some sample content, they help you to quickly get started using Squidex.

In the following example, we will use the starter sample blog to quickly create an App.

1.  Click **Starter Sample Blog** (1) to get started.
