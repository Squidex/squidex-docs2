# Roadmap

We have moved our roadmap to Trello to communicate our plans in one single place:

Squidex roadmap
{% endembed %}

The roadmap is driven by the following sources and with the following priorities.

1. Requirements from our collaborations with Enterprises.
2. Community feedback and requests.
3. Strategic features decide by us.

In general, we try to implement smaller features as quickly as possible, sometimes even on the same day. If possible we try to build features incrementally.

Please post custom-feature requests on our support forum: [https://support.squidex.io/](https://support.squidex.io).
