# Assets

## How to retrieve content?

You can retrieve the content of an asset using the id from the following url:

```text
http://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/api/assets/{id}
```

Read the API reference: [https://cloud.squidex.io/api/docs\#operation/AssetContent\_GetAssetContent](https://cloud.squidex.io/api/docs#operation/AssetContent_GetAssetContent)

> NOTE: If you install Squidex by your own you can the API reference from [https://MY-DOMAIN/api/doc](https://MY-DOMAIN/api/doc). This does not include your the documentation for your app content, that can be retrieved from [https://MY-DOMAIN/api/content/MY-APP/docs](https://MY-DOMAIN/api/content/MY-APP/docs)

## How to resize an image?

You can resize an image using the endpoint described above using the following parameters:

* `width` \(number\): The target width of the asset, if it is an image.
* `height` \(number\): The target height of the asset, if it is an image.
* `mode` \(string\): The resize mode when the width and height is defined. Default: `Max`

You have to pass in either the `width` or `height` parameter. if the asset is not an image these parameters have no effect.

Squidex supports the following resize modes:

* `Crop`: Crops the resized image to fit the bounds of its container. If the desired width and height is greater than the image dimensions it behaves like BoxPad.
* `CropUpsize`: Crops the resized image to fit the bounds of its container, also desired width and height is greater than the image dimensions.
* `Pad`: Pads the resized image to fit the bounds of its container. If only one dimension is passed, will maintain the original aspect ratio.
* `BoxPad`: Pads the image to fit the bound of the container without resizing the original source. When downscaling, performs the same functionality as `Pad`.
* `Max`: Constrains the resized image to fit the bounds of its container maintaining the original aspect ratio.
* `Min`: Resizes the image until the shortest side reaches the set given dimension. Upscaling is disabled in this mode and the original image will be returned if attempted.

## How to change the image quality?

You can also add the `quality` parameter to the asset url to define the quality from 0 \(lowest\) to 100 \(best\). If you define the quality the image will always be returned as jpeg format and you might loose transparency information.
